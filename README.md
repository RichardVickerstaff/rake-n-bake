PoolNet
========

Common rake tasks I use a lot
-----------------------------------------

PoolNet is a collection of rake tasks myself and other commanly use on our projects.
They have been extracted into a gem to allow them to easily be reused.

Installation
------------
* Install the gem or add `gem "pool_net"` to your Gemfile.

Usage
-----
PoolNet is made up of many rake tasks, add `require "pool_net"` to the top of your default.rake file to gain access to them.
You can then call them like you would any other rake task.

ToDo
----
1. Namespace all PoolNet rake tasks
2. Add a list of all the rake tasks to the Readme
2. Add a cucumber rake task
3. Add a code coverage rake task
